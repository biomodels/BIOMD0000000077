# A mathematical model quantifying GnRH-induced LH secretion from gonadotropes
by Blum et al (2000)

This paper includes three stages, and the model does not include the third
stage. Also an event is included which remove the hormone GnRH at time=5min.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the paper are reproduced, using SBML odeSolver. We
choose to encode the model with the concentration of GnRH equal to 1.0nM.
